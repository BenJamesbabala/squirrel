We trained the action model as a log-linear model, i.e. a neural network without hidden layers, on the (normalized) Fisher vectors of improved dense trajectories.
On Thumos, the validation set was segmented into single action clips and the 20 actions from UCF101 have also been used for training.
For instructions on how to train a neural network with Squirrel, see the neural network example.
